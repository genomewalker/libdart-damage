# Behavior-preservation oracle for the reference-free damage verdict.
# Re-profiles deterministic fixtures across ALL regimes (DETECTED ds/ss, LOW_ABUNDANCE,
# ABSTAIN, ROCS, modern negative) and compares VERDICT-CRITICAL JSON fields against
# per-fixture baselines captured from current behavior. Exit 0 = identical for every fixture.
#
# Verdict-critical fields (7). Each is read at its v10 path, then its v11 path, so the pre-v11
# baselines keep their full assertion power and a future schema move cannot silently blind this
# oracle again (the v11 six-section refactor did exactly that: it left every lookup throwing
# KeyError, which reads as "broken test" rather than "the caller changed its mind", and a negative
# control flipped to "damaged" behind it):
#   verdict.deamination.call   (exact: present/absent)  <- THE call; catches a negative control flipping
#   deamination.d_max_5prime_raw_ungated  (float, abs tol 1e-6)
#   deamination.d_max_3prime_raw_ungated  (float)
#   deamination.lambda_5prime             (float)
#   channel_b.d_max                       (float)
#   channel_b.valid                       (bool, exact)
#   channel_b.inverted                    (bool, exact)
# pi_estimate.{state,point} are GONE, not moved: v11 replaced the estimator (shape-fit pi demoted to
# a diagnostic, co-occurrence promoted), so the old values have no successor to assert against.
#
# authenticated_by IS asserted, against the explicit EXPECTED_ROUTE table below -- not against the
# baselines, which predate the current routes. Asserting only `call` lets a fixture pass for the
# WRONG REASON: the verdict combiner is an OR over authentication routes, so a route that breaks and
# a route that over-fires cancel in `call` and the oracle sees nothing. That is not hypothetical --
# it is exactly how the modern negative control went "present" (its d5 fit authenticated on a
# context-marginal control) while every call-level assertion stayed green. The route is the claim;
# pin it. A deliberate route change must be re-pinned here in the same commit that causes it.
#
# Fixtures (fixture, library_type, expected_route, baseline) — regime in comments:
#   fixture_det_ds  ds  pi_estimate        baseline_det_ds.json   # DETECTED ds (FLB03mAds3)
#   fixture_lowab   ds  did5_length_decay  baseline_lowab.json    # LOW_ABUNDANCE (FLB10mAds3)
#   fixture_abstain ds  none               baseline_abstain.json  # ABSTAIN (FLB45mAds1)
#   fixture_ss      ss  d5_decay_fit       baseline_ss.json       # ss (FLB03mAss4)
#   fixture_rocs    ds  channel_b          baseline_rocs.json     # ABSTAIN now (LV3003046936)
#   fixture_modern  ds  none               baseline_modern.json   # ABSTAIN, clean negative (ERR5526852 head)
#
# lowab authenticates via did5_length_decay because pi co-occurrence is SECOND-order in damage
# (x ~ pi^2 * d5 * d3) and abstains by construction at its ~4% damage, while the DiD is first-order.
# rocs rests on channel_b, which finalize_dmax.cpp:361-363 states "cannot authenticate" -- it is the
# last uncontrolled route in the OR. That is a filed, open defect; this table pins the status quo so
# that fixing it shows up here as a loud, deliberate change rather than a silent drift.
#
# Run with CAPTURE=1 to (re)capture every baseline from the current binary instead of diffing.
