# Layer-0 count-table golden gate.
#
# Re-profile each fixtured sample at -p8 and diff its Layer-0 stop-channel count tables against the
# checked-in fixture. The count tables are thread-order-independent (integer-count sums, verified) and
# emitted at setprecision(17), so a byte-exact diff IS the pre-rounded numeric check: it catches
# cap-masked z regressions (e.g. F's pre_clamp_z drifting while the emitted clamped z stays at -12),
# denominator-membership swaps, and shadow-policy changes that the emitted-JSON gate cannot see.
#
# Self-skips (exit 0) when fqdup or the external inputs are absent so CI without the data is green;
# fails (exit 1) on any count-table drift, missing fixture, or non-zero fqdup exit.
#
# NOT HERMETIC -- read before trusting a failure:
#  * The default FQ is build-icelake, an AVX-512 (-march=icelake) build, while this gate runs on
#    whatever node the scheduler hands out. On a CPU without that ISA it SIGILLs, and only on the
#    fixtures whose code paths reach the vectorised code -- so it fails per-fixture and looks
#    exactly like drift. Seen 2026-07-15: ss_ancient SIGILL on dandycmpn01fl (96c, no avx512)
#    while marine_lowcov passed on the same node, and all fixtures passed on dandycmpn17fl (192c).
#    Pin the job (--nodelist/--constraint) or set FQDUP to a portable build.
#  * FQ is a PRE-BUILT binary, NOT built from the tree under test. A stale FQ silently gates the
#    wrong code (the default was 12 days old when this note was written). Rebuild it, or set FQDUP.
