# Layer-0 count-table golden gate.
#
# Re-profile each fixtured sample at -p8 and diff its Layer-0 stop-channel count tables against the
# checked-in fixture. The count tables are thread-order-independent (integer-count sums, verified) and
# emitted at setprecision(17), so a byte-exact diff IS the pre-rounded numeric check: it catches
# cap-masked z regressions (e.g. F's pre_clamp_z drifting while the emitted clamped z stays at -12),
# denominator-membership swaps, and shadow-policy changes that the emitted-JSON gate cannot see.
#
# Self-skips (exit 0) when fqdup or the external inputs are absent so CI without the data is green;
# fails (exit 1) on any count-table drift or missing fixture.
